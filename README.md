# Scrabble-Game
This is a game I created similar to scrabble in which two players score points by forming words using the alphabet list within the game. When player 1 enters a word the game will ask both players to confirm that the word entered is correct and is found in a dictionary. When they confirm that the word is correct the game, will remove the alphabets used  by player 1 and player 2 will have his or her turn forming a word using the remaining alphabets until either one of the players enter "???" to quit the game. 

Once the "???" has been entered the game will display the winner with their score points.
